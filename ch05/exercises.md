# Hash tables

### 5.1
$f(x)$ is consistent, but not admissible. It causes colission for all $x$.

### 5.2
$f(x)$ is inconsistent.

### 5.3
$f(x)$ is inconsistent.

### 5.4
$f(x)$ is consistent.

### 5.5
Given that the "A" function is not a suitable hash function, and the "B" function is ruled out due to names with the same length, as well as the exclusion of the "C" function because of names sharing the same first letter, the most viable option emerges as the "D" function.

### 5.6
We can't use function "C" because the battery types are all represented by a single character. If we have more battery types, function "D" might also collide, so it's best to use function "B", which only computes hashes with character lengths.

### 5.7
Given that titles share the same length, opting for the "B" function is not feasible. While both the "C" and "D" functions remain viable options, the preference leans towards the "D" function, especially when factoring in the addition of another book.
